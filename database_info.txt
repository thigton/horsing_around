# A few gcloud client queries that were semi-useful - probably easier to just use GUI google client
gcloud sql connect horsing-around # connects to horsing-around instance (puts you into sql mode)
gcloud sql databases list --instance=horsing-around # lists databases in horsing-around instance
gcloud sql instances list # not tried yet, might list instances
gcloud sql databases create db-horsing-around --instance=horsing-around # don't repeat this, just a log of what I did to create it


###### SQL Manager for PostgreSQL Lite ######
# Connecting to Google SQL 
1. Click 'register database'
2. Host name = Public IP address from Google Cloud instance overview
   User name and password = from 'users' in gcloud instance tab (you can make a new user if you need to)
Note - You might need to add your public ip address (google it) to the instance connections tab
That's it... Now you can double click into the database and write queries
